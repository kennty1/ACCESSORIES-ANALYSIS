## Objectives
+ To comprehend seasonality or long-term growth, find trends in sales volume, revenue, and profit over several months or years.
+ To assist with focused marketing, investigate how age and gender affect order quantity, profitability, and purchasing behavior.
+ To determine high-performing regions and places that require work, compare sales performance across states and nations (for example, Australia vs. Canada).
+ To Find out which client or geographic areas produce the largest profit margins and which may be causing losses.
+ To inform more sensible pricing and discounting practices, assess the impact of unit price against unit cost on total profit per order.
